                    <p>
                        As mentioned in homepage, I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I worked as a software engineer at Apple for Siri, Siri Messages where I worked on improving displayed features for interpretation of Messages.

                        I like to contribute to the world and produce the most delightful products possible and work for the best efforts. Some traits I value include dedication, innovation, and clarity. I pride academic work and authenticity in writing. When I am not at work, I usually enjoy cooking/baking and designing digital art, whether on iPad or Illustrator.
