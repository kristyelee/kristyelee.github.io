                I worked as a full-time software engineer at Apple working for Siri (Siri Communication Products) [Dec. 2022-Mar. 2024]. 
                <br><br>
                In Summer 2021, I worked at <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></strong> as a <strong>AI/ML Domains Software Engineering Intern</strong> on the <strong>Siri Experience (Siri Messages)</strong> team. I worked on the identification and classification of important messages in Siri Messages. I enjoyed the work and the creation of the prototype.

                In Summer 2020, I worked at <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></strong> as a <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong> on the <strong>iOS System Experience team</strong>. I designed and implemented machine learning classifier for incoming text-based bug reports using Swift NLP APIs. My work performance was enjoyable and I liked learning about creation using Swift.

                In Spring 2020, the spring semester of sophomore year, I worked with Statistics postdoc Xiaowu Dai to research the generalization gap associated with large batch training. I implemented and experimented with multiple neural network architecture models (AlexNet, VGG).
                <br><br>
                In Fall 2019, the fall semester of sophomore year, I worked at <strong><a href="https://seti.berkeley.edu">Berkeley SETI Research Center</a></strong> as a undergraduate researcher and was accepted through the Berkeley URAP program. I trained a convolutional neural network to distinguish fast radio bursts (FRBs) from radio frequency inference (RFI). I integrated the training models into Breakthrough Listen signal-retrieval pipeline.
                <br><br>
                Throughout freshman and sophomore year (Spring 2019 - Spring 2020), I worked on Berkeley's CS61A Software Team (<strong>Berkeley Educators Engineering Software</strong>) on the CS61A Office Hour Queue website. I fixed bugs in the front-end and back-end implementation of the website, and worked on improving the wait-time computation for people waiting on the online office hour queue.
