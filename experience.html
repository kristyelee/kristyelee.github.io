                This summer, I am working at <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></strong> as a <strong>AI/ML Domains Software Engineering Intern</strong> on the <strong>Siri Experience (Siri Messages)</strong> team. I am working on the identification and classification of important messages in Siri Messages. <br><br>

                I'm currently doing research in the <strong><a href="http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu">Berkeley NLP Group</a></strong>, under PhD candidate Rudy Corona, advised by <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~klein/">Dan Klein</a> and <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~trevor/">Trevor Darrell</a>. Previously, I was doing research with PhD candidate Ruiqi Zhong, advised by Dan Klein. With Ruiqi I did research on zero-shot classification and investigation of the translation of language into executable commands in a grounded environment. I contributed to the following <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.04670.pdf">paper</a> as a second author.

                    Machine learning (ML) methods are increasingly used in day to day settings to make decisions for us, spanning the contexts of hiring, defendant sentencing, and more. One of the major unresolved questions in these applications is that of fairness, i.e. ensuring that the decisions made by these automated systems are not biased against any of the groups being considered. Numerous mathematical definitions of fairness exist, optimizing different ideas of what it means to be "fair," and are used differentially across ML algorithms. Understanding and perceptions of these fairness definitions by the numerous stakeholders in relevant decisions, however, remain largely unaddressed. This work takes steps to fill this gap, using cognitive/intervews and surveys. The purpose this research is two-fold:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Evaluate and understand lay comprehension of different fairness metrics</li>
                    <li>Interrogate expert perceptions of, and desires for, automated decision making systems</li>
                </ul><br>

                    Commercial DNA testing has become increasingly popular. Companies like 23andMe and Ancestry.com partially sequence customers' DNA and return results about their heritage, susceptibility to genetic disease, and other personal information. This raises severe privacy concerns, as DNA contains a large collection of information about an individual and their close relatives. Users of these services may not be aware of the extent of the information they are revealing to a commercial entity. This work aims to evaluate user awareness of the extent of information they are revealing to these companies and the privacy risks associated with DNA testing with an open-ended interview study. Four main research questions are addressed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>What information do users believe is revealed by their genetic data?</li>
                    <li>What concerns, if any, do users have with respect to DTC genetic testing?</li>
                    <li>How do usersâ€™ concerns influence their decisions to participate in DTC genetic testing?</li>
                    <li>How do users believe their genetic information is used by DTC genetic testing companies?</li>
                </ul><br>

                In Summer 2020, I worked at <strong><a href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</a></strong> as a <strong>Software Engineering Intern</strong> on the <strong>iOS System Experience team</strong>. I designed and implemented machine learning classifier for incoming text-based bug reports using Swift NLP APIs, and built a MacOS app with a word tagging system tool used to quickly identify the subject/problematic element of every bug report.

                In Spring 2020, the spring semester of sophomore year, I worked with Statistics postdoc Xiaowu Dai to research the generalization gap associated with large batch training. I implemented and experimented with multiple neural network architecture models (AlexNet, VGG).

I trained a convolutional neural network to distinguish fast radio bursts (FRBs) from radio frequency inference (RFI). I integrated the training models into Breakthrough Listen signal-retrieval pipeline.

                Throughout freshman and sophomore year (Spring 2019 - Spring 2020), I worked on Berkeley's CS61A Software Team (<strong>Berkeley Educators Engineering Software</strong>) on the CS61A Office Hour Queue website. I fixed bugs in the front-end and back-end implementation of the website, and worked on improving the wait-time computation for people waiting on the online office hour queue.
