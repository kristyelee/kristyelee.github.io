Hi. This is my momentarily finished website. Desktop is the preferred platform for viewing this website; design for mobile phone isn't fully polished. Note - this does not utilize Bootstrap or any web framework, but rather is a website I've put together. Regardless I focused on layout and color scheme to ensure they're pleasant looking.
