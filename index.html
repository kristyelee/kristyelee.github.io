                        I am a recent graduate from UC Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. My experience is work as a software engineer at Apple [started December 2022] for Siri (SaLT: Siri and Language Technologies), part of the AI/ML organization. Previously, I completed two successful internships at Apple as a software engineering intern. Additionally, during some of my undergraduate studies I did research in the <a href=http://nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/>Berkeley NLP Group</a>, a research group in Berkeley Artificial Intelligence Research.
